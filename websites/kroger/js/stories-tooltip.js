            "Content" : "Last year, Fair Oaks began powering its vehicles fueled by compressed natural gas (CNG) with cleaned, renewable natural gas generated from the cow manure produced on the farm. This established a first-of-its-kind “closed loop” system of producing and delivering fluid milk to Kroger's dairy processing facilities. Since the CNG trucks have been up and running, they have traveled more than <strong>11.6 million miles, reduced greenhouse gases by 6,892 metric tons,</strong> taken the equivalent of <strong>2.3 million gallons</strong> of diesel fuel off the road, and provided more than <strong>5,000 MWh</strong> of electricity to the farm. We call it cow power!",

Kroger supports the social and environmental efforts that Regal Springs brings to life.  They are a true supplier-partner in providing us some of the highest quality, freshest, most sustainable tilapia available. ",

Included as food waste is food that cannot be sold or donated and on-site food processing effluent. This biogas is then turned into power for on-site operations. The system will provide enough renewable biogas to offset more than 20% of the energy demand for the 650,000-square-foot Ralphs/Food 4 Less distribution center.  The system will also reduce area truck trips by more than <strong>500,000 miles</strong> each year. These efforts are estimated to reduce carbon emissions by an estimated <strong>90,000 tons per year</strong>.",
