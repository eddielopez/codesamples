                <p>We listen as our customers tell us what is important to them in our communities. We engage with local community partners to feed the hungry, support women’s health, the military and local
                    non-profits and schools. In 2012, with participation of our 343,000 associates, the Kroger family of stores:</p>
                
                <ul>      
                    <li><span>Donated the <strong><em>largest contribution of food and funds</em></strong> in our history—the equivalent of nearly <strong><em>200 million meals</em></strong>—to local food banks in the Feeding America network.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Engaged vendors and customers to contribute <strong><em>more than $5.9 million in support of women’s health and breast cancer awareness programs.</em></strong></span></li>
                    <li><span>Raised <strong><em>$3.3 million for the USO</em></strong> to help them in their work supporting the military and their families. This is the largest one-time gift in the USO’s history.
</span></li>
<li><span>Supported more than 30,000 local non-profit organizations—more than <strong><em>$48.5 million</em></strong>—through our Community Rewards program.</span></li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>We also invested in our <strong><em>associates</em></strong> and their families in a variety of ways, including:</p>
                
                <ul>
                	<li><span>Spending more than <strong><em>$1.5 billion</em></strong> to provide health care to many of our full- and part-time associates and some retirees.</span></li>
                	<li><span><strong><em>Partnering with associates</em></strong> in innovative safety programs that have reduced accident rates in our stores and manufacturing plants <strong><em>by 76 percent since 1995,</em></strong> making Kroger one of the safest companies in America.</span></li>

                <p>We remain committed to making thoughtful and responsible choices to minimize our impact on the environment—some examples include:</p>
                <ul>
                	<li><span>Achieving total energy reduction of <strong><em>32.7 percent</em></strong> from our base year. We are on track to meet our goal of a 35 percent reduction by 2015.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Continuing our partnership with the <strong><em>World Wildlife Fund</em></strong> and supported <strong><em>four wild-caught fishery improvement projects</em></strong> around the world.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Increasing our focus on moving more of our facilities toward zero waste. Today,<strong><em> 21 of our
37 manufacturing plants have achieved “zero waste,”</em></strong> per the EPA’s WasteWise guidelines. Our stores divert approximately 58% of our waste away from landfills and incinerators. Our teams have committed to a goal of increasing the diversion rate to <strong><em>65% across our 2,400 stores for 2013.</em></strong>
</span></li>
                    <li><span>Publicly committing to source <strong><em>100% certified sustainable palm oil</em></strong> used in our corporate brand products by the end of 2015.</span></li>
