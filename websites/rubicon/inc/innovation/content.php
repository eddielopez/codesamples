                <p>Rubicon’s technological and market leadership are directly attributable to its heritage of innovation and vertical integration. This end-to-end manufacturing capability, with unparalleled intellectual property at each step of the manufacturing process, results in an advantageous cost structure and provides better control of product quality and delivery schedules.</p>

<p>Vertical integration is the catalyst driving Rubicon innovations—from the ability to grow progressively larger sapphire while maintaining exceptional quality, to being first to market with large-diameter wafers. To date, Rubicon has shipped more than 400,000 six-inch wafers—a number that will grow as more manufacturers seek to leverage the inherent cost efficiencies of larger-diameter substrates. Our expertise in and control of every link in the sapphire value chain spurs continuous improvement and refinement of the manufacturing process.</p>

<p>In 2012, Rubicon moved closer to full deployment of its in-house capability to purify and densify raw powdered aluminum oxide into the material used in the sapphire crystal growth process. This capability gives Rubicon more control over supply and quality and, when fully implemented in mid-2013, will result in significant cost savings. Also in 2012, patents for processes and technologies covering precision wafer grinding and polishing and in-situ orientation of sapphire crystals were issued to Rubicon by the United States Patent and Trademark Office.</p>

<p>The innovations made possible through vertical integration continue to drive sapphire adoption in markets beyond LEDs. In 2012, Rubicon announced a ground-breaking project, dubbed Large-Area Net-shape Crystal Extraction (LANCE), developed to produce optical quality large-area rectangular sapphire windows up to two inches thick for military sensing applications. The project, supported by a contract with the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), has a total value of $4.7 million over three years.</p>

<P>At Rubicon, unparalleled innovation is not a goal or a marketing catch phrase; it is the culmination of everything we do.</P>
