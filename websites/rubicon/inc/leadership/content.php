                <p>Large-diameter sapphire substrates are a critical component in the cost-effective production of LEDs for all end markets, and particularly for general lighting. Rubicon’s vertically integrated, end-to-end manufacturing capabilities and proven crystal growth technology have propelled the company to a leadership position in the large-diameter sapphire.</p>

<p>Among the many initiatives undertaken by Rubicon’s research and development team, work on patterned sapphire substrates (PSS) has been a primary focus recently. Before beginning the MOCVD process, most LED manufacturers etch a pattern onto sapphire substrates to facilitate epitaxial growth and to extract more light from each LED chip. This year, Rubicon expects to be the first to market with large-diameter patterned substrates for LED customers—allowing them to remove this pre-production process from their regimen and focus on their core technology.</p>

<p>As the trusted supplier of choice to a growing global LED market, Rubicon continues to invest in the intellectual property and expertise that the industry demands and is strongly positioned to capitalize on the tremendous opportunity presented by the lighting market.</p>

<p>Demand for sapphire continues to expand into additional diverse applications and markets, and Rubicon is uniquely positioned to provide the broad range of high-quality sapphire products required to address these emerging markets.</p>
