 <h5 class="blue">Broad adoption of LEDs in general lighting is assured, pointing to steadily improving worldwide demand for sapphire substrates in the LED market.</h5>
                
                <p>Today, LEDs remain the single largest end market for sapphire, and within that market, the two primary applications are general lighting and LCD backlighting for televisions, computers, tablets and mobile devices. The use of LEDs in general illumination has now entered a period of accelerating growth, providing a renewed opportunity for Rubicon’s vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities and global leadership in large-diameter sapphire production to have an impact.</p>

<p>The advantages of LEDs in general lighting are well-documented and compelling. Energy savings, long lifetime, reliability and environmental friendliness are positioning LEDs as the technology of choice for general lighting. Today, as LED prices decline, product quality improves, lumens-per-dollar rise, and payback periods for commercial applications shorten, broad adoption of LEDs in general lighting is assured, pointing to steadily improving worldwide demand for sapphire substrates in the LED market.</p>

<p>Sapphire’s versatility and inherent physical characteristics—including hardness, resistance to corrosion, light transmission and thermal insulation—make it an ideal material for a wide range of additional applications, including optical windows and RFIC. Silicon-on-Sapphire (SoS) RFIC technology is poised to be adopted for additional applications as well, and Rubicon’s vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities and legacy of quality and volume delivery will continue to make us the supplier of choice.</p>

<p>Moving forward, look for sapphire to gain favor as an alternative material for faceplates or covers in smart phones and other consumer electronic devices. Given sapphire’s extreme hardness, fabrication costs make this particular application somewhat cost-prohibitive today. But Rubicon is working on alternative approaches to address this opportunity. A technology breakthrough could open up a market several times the size of the LED market for sapphire.</p>
